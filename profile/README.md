FlipQueue
=====

FlipQueue is a company that does classroom management for the flipped classroom. That means that it helps to keep track of what students are doing on their own, and helps teacher-assisted time to be productive and interactive.

I'm still working on the grade report platform and the screen management application, but I've just published a couple of repositories that I will work on first so that teachers that are interested in flipping their classroom can start working on their materials.
