FlipQueue
=====

FlipQueue is a company that does classroom management for the flipped classroom. That means that it helps to keep track of what students are doing at home, and helps classtime to be productive and interactive.

I'm still working on the grade report platform and the screen management application, but I've just published a couple of repositories that I will work on first so that teachers that are interested in flipping their classroom can start working on their materials.

Simple, which is under construction, will be a sample app that people can use to start integrating with the grade report platform that I have not yet published.

Simpler, which is also under construction, doesn't have anything particularly FlipQueue-specific about it. It's just a sample database backed app that tech support can stand up for teachers that want to start working on educational materials. Growing programmers can also use it as a template to start making more complicated apps than the `Simplest` app. 

Simplest is intended to be a first app for people with an interest in educational software development. I'll be checking the issues etc for questions and ways to make this repository easier to use for first-time developers.
