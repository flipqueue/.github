FlipQueue
=====

FlipQueue is a company that does classroom management for the flipped classroom. That means that it helps to keep track of what students are doing at home, and helps classtime to be productive and interactive.

I'm still working on the grade report platform and the screen management application, but I've just published a couple of repositories that I will work on first so that teachers that are interested in flipping their classroom can start working on their materials.
